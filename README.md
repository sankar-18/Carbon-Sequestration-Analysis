# Carbon Sequestration Analysis ðŸŒ³ðŸ“Š

## Overview

This repository contains data and code for analyzing carbon sequestration through Rubber Trees and Pineapple plants. 

## Data and Calculations

### Rubber Trees
- Total Rubber Trees Predicted: 15,340 (13% of total trees prediction)
- Total additionality of Carbon stored through Rubber trees:
  - 2020: 453,643.74 * ln(2020) - 3,449,595.49 tons/year
  - 2021: 453,643.74 * ln(2021) - 3,449,595.49 tons/year

### Pineapple Plants
- Total Pineapple Plants Predicted: 102,660 (87% of total trees prediction)
- Total additionality of Carbon stored through Pineapple plants:
  - 2019: 62,400.96 * ln(2020) - 474,639.73 tons/year
  - 2020: 62,400.96 * ln(2021) - 474,639.73 tons/year

### Total Carbon Sequestration
- Actual Trees/Plants: 115,000
- Actual Total additionality of Carbon stored in total trees/plants/year: Calculated as the sum of Carbon stored through Rubber trees and Pineapple plants.
- Actual Total additionality of CO2 stored in total trees/plants/year: Calculated based on the conversion factor of 44/12.

## Results

- Predicted Total Trees/Plants: Sum of Predicted Rubber Trees and Predicted Pineapple Plants.
- Predicted Total additionality of Carbon stored in all trees and plants/year: Calculated based on the predicted counts and carbon storage per tree/plant.
- Predicted Total additionality of CO2 stored in all trees and plants/year: Calculated based on the conversion factor of 44/12.
